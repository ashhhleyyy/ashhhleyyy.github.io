description: A link storage server

Linkbox was my experiment for learning the [Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org) for [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and is a simple service
for storing links on a self-hosted server where you can access them later.

You can find the backend on GitHub [here](https://github.com/ashhhleyyy/linkbox-backend), along with a simple CLI tool [here](https://github.com/ashhhleyyy/linkbox-cli).
