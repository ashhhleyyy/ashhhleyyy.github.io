description: Simple social profiles
---

notme.ml is a simple website somewhat inspired by [ppl.moe](https://ppl.moe/), that allows you to share a collection of social media links on a full-screen card page. You can check out my card [here](https://notme.ml/u/ash), and you can log in with Discord and create your own [here](https://notme.ml/).

The site is built with [next.js](https://nextjs.org), and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It uses a [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) database hosted on [MongoDB Atlas](https://mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to store users and profiles.
