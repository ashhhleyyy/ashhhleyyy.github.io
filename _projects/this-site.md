description: The page you're on right now!

I built this site using mostly just plain HTML, however I used Jekyll and SCSS to make my life a little easier.
There is also a small API service written in Rust for the now playing widget on the [about page](/about), which pulls information from [last.fm](https://last.fm) and is kindly hosted by a friend.
The rest of the site is deployed on GitHub pages, and you can check out the source [here](https://github.com/ashisbored/ashisbored.github.io).
