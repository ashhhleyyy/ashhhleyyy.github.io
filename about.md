# Hello ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Ash, and I'm a trans girl from the UK who does random [projects](/projects) with [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/), [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and other things.

You can find me on quite a few platforms, such as the following:
- <i class="fab fa-discord"></i>  [Discord (@Ash.#7558)](https://discord.com/users/828168927762841601)
- <i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> [Mastodon (@ash@tech.lgbt)](https://tech.lgbt/@ash)
- <i class="fab fa-reddit"></i>   [Reddit (/u/ash_b_)](https://reddit.com/u/ash_b_)
- <i class="fab fa-github"></i>   [GitHub (ashisbored)](https://github.com/ashisbored)
- [Matrix (@ash:tomthegeek.ml)](https://matrix.to/#/@ash:tomthegeek.ml)

I also have some accounts under my old name (that I try to avoid sharing), including old projects and things, so send me a message on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@ash:tomthegeek.ml) or [Discord](https://discord.com/users/828168927762841601) if you are interested.
